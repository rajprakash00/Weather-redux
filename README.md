### Weather-App

A webapp showing weather datas of cities & less focused on UI rather more on getting comfortable with redux,redux-saga and middlewares.

#### Usage:
- clone it
- `npm install`
- Get your API key [here](https://openweathermap.org/) & replace it in code

#### If one wants to use map:
- go to index.html(in public dir)
- write your google API key(billing is needed :frowning_face:) & replace it in code

#### Enjoy!
